    "Hey there and welcome to my YouTube channel! My name is HAMZA, and I'm so excited to have you here with me today.\n",
    "On this channel, we explore all sorts of interesting and inspiring stories, from real-life experiences to fictional tales that transport us to new worlds.\n",
    "Today, I want to share a special story with you called 'The Big Deal.' It's a story about perseverance, hard work, and the power of believing in yourself.\n",
    "So grab a comfy seat, settle in, and let's dive into this amazing tale. Are you ready? Let's go!\n",
    "As I emptied the fiftieth trash can of the day into the giant black bin, I couldn't help but chuckle. To most people, my job as a janitor in a hospital wasn't glamorous, but to me, it was everything. I took pride in my work, ensuring that each room was spotless and ready for the next patient.\n",
    "I took off my gloves and threw them in the dumpster on my way out. As I reached for my phone, it rang in my pocket. It was my boss, Jeff, asking if I could stay for another 8 hours. I had already worked a 12-hour shift, but I couldn't let Jeff down. \"Fine,\" I said, \"but is it overtime?\"\n",
    "Jeff sighed in relief and said, \"Of course, Brian. Always.\"\n",
    "Heading back into the hospital, I walked through the halls with ease, dodging carts and frantic nurses. I was used to the chaos by now. I knew each wing of the hospital like the back of my hand.\n",
    "Entering a new wing, I stepped into a room where a slim girl lay in a hospital bed. She seemed to be asleep, but as I emptied the trash can, she shifted and spoke softly, \"Water.\" I pressed the call light, and a young nurse in pink scrubs appeared before me. \"She wants water,\" I told her.\n",
    "The nurse was surprised and said, \"She hasn't spoken for days.\" I shrugged and moved on to the next room.\n",
    "The next room was dimly lit, and I could barely make out the figure in the bed. I was surprised to see that the room had an occupant. I usually got out of dealing with people in every room; I just cleaned and went my way. But this time, I felt drawn to the man in the bed.\n",
    "His breath rattled deep in his lungs, and I closed my eyes for a moment, feeling the pain of human suffering. The man stirred and his half-closed eyes lit up when he saw me. \"Do you know Joni?\" he asked.\n",
    "I nodded, and he smiled, giving me a flash of his yellowed dentures. \"Tell her thank you for the brownies.\"\n",
    "His eyes fluttered closed, and I waited for the rattle of breath, but it never came. The nurse and doctor that came in rushed me out the same way I had come. This man wouldn't need the room cleaned now, but I'd be back later.\n",
    "As I walked away, I thought about the last words of that old gentleman. Thanking Joni for brownies—his last words he ever said in his life were a thank you. It struck me that there are all kinds of people in this world, some uppity and too good to look at someone like me, a sanitation worker, cleaner, or even a janitor. But today, I had heard a man's last words, and they were a thank you to another janitor.\n",
    "As I finished cleaning up a spill in the hallway, an alarm blared over the intercom. I couldn't make out the words over the clamor of doctors rushing past me. It sounded like a trauma patient, but I wasn't sure. A hospital bed with a man...\n",
